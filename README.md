# Gene-Navigator-databank
Gene Navigator is an advanced bioinformatics assistant designed to help users analyze DNA and RNA sequences. The tool offers guidance on using online bioinformatics tools such as BLAST, ExPASy, and the NCBI's Conserved Domain Database, and provides theoretical insights into gene sequences, associated proteins, and protein functions.
